    <string name="rules_rules_text">
        The main goal is to stay alive. On your turn, draw the top card
        from the deck and add it to your hand. Then choose one of the two
        cards in your hand and discard it face up in front of you. Apply any
        effect on the card you discarded. You must apply its effect, even if it
        is bad for you. All discarded cards remain in front of the player who
        discarded them. This helps players to figure out which cards other players
        might be holding. Once you finish applying the cardâ€™s effect, the turn passes
        to the next player.
